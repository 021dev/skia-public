This branch contains project-wide configurations for chrome-infra services.

After modifying main.star, run
```
lucicfg generate main.star
```
or equivalently just
```
./main.star
```

lucicfg is part of depot_tools, so if the above command doesn't work, make
sure your depot_tools is up-to-date:
```
update_depot_tools
```
